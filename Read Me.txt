----------------------------------------
 1. Features: - Is a very powerful program that allows you to peek
    Inside a GameMaker exe or any other exe for that matter.  Allows you
    you to dump the memory contents of a running process and attempt to 
    decrypt a gamemaker exe program.  Even comes with a guide to do it step by step
    I highly suggest using the guide!. Thats how I decrypt each exe!
    Even if you can't get it to decrypt you can still dump the bmps and
    the wavs, and scripts. Just make sure you set your memory limit high enough.
    One step beta decompile has been in since ver .19.  I hope in the future that
    I can decode the exe without going in to memory that will make it work for so many more people then.

----------------------------------------
 2. Using Attach Process
    Attach process allows you dump the memory of a certain process.
    Allows you to set the high and low memory limits of an exe to dump the memory
    When you dump the memory it allows my program to find the encryption key. 
    New and improved! Now contains Application Icon pictures!
    The lowerlimit is the base address of the running process.

----------------------------------------
 3. Using Open Exe
    Main function of this is to to get the game.enc. Or the gmd that is encrypted
    And decrypt it using the key either found from memory or overrided
    from the options panel.  Then once you have the game.enc you just extract the gmd.
    You should use attach to process before using this function.

----------------------------------------
 4. Using Force Decrypt
    Force Decrypt is a function that allows you decrypt a file according to the gamemaker
    encryption version so you can use 5.3a encryption or 5.3 encryption.
    It is of not much use to most people. I only use it to decode 5.4 exe's.

----------------------------------------
 5. Using Brute Force
    To use the brute force function first you must run your game and
    use attach to process or the guide to dump the memory of it.
    Then the brute force will attempt to find keys in dump file.
    It may find more than one try them each until you find one that works.
    Use the key by double clicking the offset in the listbox this loads the encryption key.
    Then do an open exe and select the same exe to decrypt it.

----------------------------------------
 6. Using Bmp Extractor
    Is a tool that you can use to extract bmps out of memory
    And even other exes and files.
    Just make sure you have the limit high enough.

----------------------------------------
 7. Using Wav Extractor
    Is a tool that you can use to extract wavs out of memory
    And even other exes and files.
    Just make sure you have the limit high enough.

----------------------------------------
 8. Making your own Plugin
    I have included a sample plugin coded in Visual Basic.
    I will soon try to have a C++ example as well.
    With plugins you can write your own extractors for other file formats
    Some Ideas are PNG GIF JPEG files etc
    In order to run your plugin you need to place .dll file in the plugins folder.

----------------------------------------
 9. Help
    In this version I have tired to make it easier. 
    I have included a step by step guide to decrypting
    a gamemaker exe into a gamemaker gmd file.

    Questions:

    Why does it say keyfound=false?
    Because it cannot find the encryption key
    Different versions of windows have different offsets for the key.
    I suggest you install all the vb runtime files

    Why does it make game.enc but not game.gmd?
    That means it probably keyfound=false and that the encryption could not be found
    Game.enc is the attempted decrypted file. I then try to to extract the gmd from game.enc

    It won't extract the gmd!
    It should say Finding GMD Start Offset Location
    Then check the second line there should be a number if not
    then it did not find the encryption key.

    The program complains about psapi
    Means you are running win98 or lower because thoose O/S lack that dll file.
    I use psapi for two important api functionis for attach process

    The program complains about a missing file
    First search on google.com for that file
    Make sure you have the vb runtime files installed.

    I have vb6, vb.net, c++, and Asm versions of the code in development.
    I am currently working on a way to decrypt the .exe's without going into memory.
    Keep checking back for more things to come.
